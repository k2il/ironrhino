Ironrhino is a fullstack(include server side and frontend) framework base on spring,struts,hibernate,zookeeper,elasticsearch,jquery,bootstrap and other sophisticated opensource libs.

  1. natural support for ajax,seamless with serverside(plain struts action with Annotation) and frontend(no need to write js just html markup),can de degraded gracefully if browser doesn't support js.
  1. built-in profiles for different environment and scale,can be deployed to cloudfoundry without any change of code.
  1. fulltext search with elasticsearch,just a few annotation.
  1. distributed service framework with zookeeper and hissian,httpinvoker.
  1. oauth client for v1 and v2,server side for v2.
