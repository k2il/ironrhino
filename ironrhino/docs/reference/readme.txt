We're using the DocBook XSL distribution for HTML and PDF
generation. The best results can be achieved with the
Saxon XSLT processor (don't use Xalan!) and the Apache
FOP library.

The documentation is generated by Compass's build.xml file
for Ant. Targets included are:

* doc.pdf        - generates the PDF documentation
* doc.html       - generates the HTML documentation
* doc.htmlsingle - generates single page HTML documentation
* doc.clean      - clean any output directories for docs

Thanks to Hibernate & Spring, for providing the skeleton for
DocBook documentation!
